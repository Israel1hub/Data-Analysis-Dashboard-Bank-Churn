#BANK CHURN ANALYSIS (Interactive dashboard and analysis using MS excel) 

##Problem Statement:
Why are some customers ghosting our bank?
In recent months, we've noticed that a growing number of customers are closing their accounts and 
walking away. Are they unhappy with our services, or are competitors winning their hearts? This 
project aims to uncover the secret patterns behind customer churn by digging into their 
demographics, behaviors, complaints, satisfaction scores, and product usage. Let's find out who’s 
leaving, why they’re leaving, and what we can do to keep them!
